**A configuration framework that enhances Cursor IDE with specialized commands, cognitive personas, and development methodologies.**

## üöÄ Version 3.0.0 - Cursor IDE Adaptation

**MAJOR UPDATE**: SuperClaude now works with Cursor IDE instead of Claude Code!

SuperClaude v3 introduces complete Cursor IDE integration:

- **üéØ Cursor Native**: Built for Cursor's `.cursor/rules` system
- **üé≠ Enhanced Personas**: 9 cognitive personas as individual rule files
- **üì¶ Smart Installation**: `install-cursor.sh` with project and global modes
- **üîß Rule-Based Architecture**: Leverages Cursor's AI rule system
- **‚ö° Natural Language Commands**: No more slash commands - use natural language
- **üéØ Context-Aware Activation**: Rules activate based on context and mentions

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for future development ideas and contribution opportunities.

## üéØ Background

Cursor IDE provides powerful AI-assisted development but can benefit from:
- **Specialized expertise** for different technical domains
- **Structured workflows** for complex projects  
- **Evidence-based approaches** to development
- **Context preservation** during development sessions
- **Domain-specific thinking** for various tasks

## ‚ú® SuperClaude Features

SuperClaude enhances Cursor IDE with:
- **18 Specialized Commands** covering development lifecycle tasks
- **9 Cognitive Personas** for domain-specific approaches
- **Token Optimization** with compression options
- **Evidence-Based Methodology** encouraging documentation
- **MCP Integration** with Context7, Sequential, Magic, Puppeteer
- **Git Checkpoint Support** for safe experimentation
- **Introspection Mode** for framework improvement and troubleshooting

## üöÄ Installation

### Cursor IDE Installation v3.0.0
The installer provides project and global installation options:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zeeeepa/SuperClaude.git
cd SuperClaude

# Project installation (recommended)
./install-cursor.sh                    # Installs to .cursor/rules

# Global installation
./install-cursor.sh --global          # Available in all projects

# Advanced options
./install-cursor.sh --update          # Update existing installation
./install-cursor.sh --dry-run --verbose # Preview changes with details
./install-cursor.sh --force           # Skip confirmations (automation)
./install-cursor.sh --log install.log # Log all operations
```

**v3.0.0 Installer Features:**
- üéØ **Project Mode**: Install in current project's `.cursor/rules`
- üåê **Global Mode**: Install for all Cursor projects
- üîÑ **Update Mode**: Preserves customizations while updating
- üëÅÔ∏è **Dry Run**: Preview changes before applying
- üíæ **Smart Backups**: Automatic backup with timestamping
- üñ•Ô∏è **Platform Detection**: Works with Linux, macOS, Windows
- üìä **Progress Tracking**: Installation feedback

Zero dependencies. Installs to `.cursor/rules` by default.

**Note:** After installation, all rule files are located in `.cursor/rules` and are version-controlled with your project.

## üí° Core Capabilities

### üß† **Cognitive Personas (Natural Language Activation!)**
Switch between different approaches using natural language:

```
"Use SuperClaude analyze with architect persona to review this system"
"Apply frontend persona to build this React component"  
"Take security persona and scan this authentication code"
"Use analyzer persona to troubleshoot this production issue"
```

**v3.0.0 Update**: All 9 personas are now individual rule files that activate through natural language mentions, providing specialized approaches contextually.

### ‚ö° **19 Commands**
Development lifecycle coverage:

**Development Commands**
```
"Use SuperClaude build to create a React app with TypeScript and testing"
"Apply SuperClaude dev-setup for CI/CD pipeline configuration"
"Run SuperClaude test with comprehensive coverage and E2E testing"
```

**Analysis & Quality**
```
"Use SuperClaude review with QA persona for code quality analysis"
"Apply SuperClaude analyze to examine this system architecture"
"Run SuperClaude troubleshoot to resolve this production issue"
"Use SuperClaude improve for performance optimization"
"Apply SuperClaude explain to document this complex feature"
```

**Operations & Security**
```
"Use SuperClaude deploy to plan production deployment strategy"
"Apply SuperClaude scan with security persona for vulnerability assessment"
"Run SuperClaude migrate for database schema changes"
"Use SuperClaude cleanup to optimize project maintenance"
```

### üéõÔ∏è **MCP Integration**
- **Context7**: Access to library documentation
- **Sequential**: Multi-step reasoning capabilities
- **Magic**: AI-generated UI components
- **Puppeteer**: Browser testing and automation

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** SuperClaude does not include MCP servers. You need to install them separately in Cursor's MCP settings to use MCP-related capabilities when available.

### üìä **Token Efficiency**
SuperClaude's @include template system helps manage token usage:
- **UltraCompressed mode** option for token reduction
- **Template references** for configuration management
- **Caching mechanisms** to avoid redundancy
- **Context-aware compression** options
