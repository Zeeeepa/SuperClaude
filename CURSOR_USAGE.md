### Update and Maintenance
```bash
# Update existing installation
./install-cursor.sh --update

# Preview changes
./install-cursor.sh --dry-run --verbose

# Verify installation
./install-cursor.sh --verify
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Rules Not Activating
1. Ensure SuperClaude is properly installed in `.cursor/rules`
2. Check that you're mentioning "SuperClaude" in your requests
3. Verify Cursor IDE is recognizing the rules directory
4. Try restarting Cursor IDE if rules aren't loading

### Command Not Working
1. Check the exact command name in `.cursor/rules/commands/`
2. Ensure you're using natural language activation
3. Try different phrasing: "Use SuperClaude [command]" or "Apply SuperClaude [command]"
4. Verify the command file exists and is properly formatted

### Persona Not Responding
1. Check persona files exist in `.cursor/rules/personas/`
2. Use clear persona references: "with [persona] persona" or "take [persona] persona"
3. Ensure persona names match file names (architect, security, frontend, etc.)
4. Try combining with commands for better activation

## üìö Best Practices

### Effective Command Usage
- Be specific about your goals and requirements
- Mention relevant technologies and constraints
- Provide context about your project and team
